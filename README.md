# Rebrandly Slack Bot
This Slack Bot can be installed to provide your workspace with a quick and easy way to shorten URLs using the Rebrandly API. Simply provide the bot with a URL to shorten and it will return the resultant response from the Rebrandly API.

# Getting Started
## Create SlackApp
Complete the process of creating and installing a [SlackApp](https://api.slack.com/), saving the `OAuth Access Token` & `Bot User OAuth Access Token` generated by the Slack API to be used in step 2 below.


## Running the Bot
1. Clone this repo and rename the provided `templates` directory to `secrets`. This directory is included in the `.gitignore` file to ensure all secrets are ommitted from tracking/commits.
    ```
    $ mv templates secrets
    ```


2. Modify the provided `secrets.json.template` file to contain your Slackbot API & Rebrandly secrets.
    ```
    $ mv secrets.json.template secrets.json
    ```


3. Run the bot. If successfully running, you should see a message following the execution
    ```
    $ python bot.py
    Assignment Bot is now running!
    ```

# Interacting with the bot
Currently, the bot supports the operation to shorten any provided URL using the following interaction:
```
@[botname] [url]
```

For example, if you named your bot `rebrandlybot`, then the following will generate a rebranded URL:
```
@rebrandlybot https://www.sample.com
```

To ask the bot for help, use:
```
@rebrandlybot help
